Custom Post Type Slides
=============

This code was used to present custom post types at the [Boston WordPress meetup](http://bostonwp.org).
Each slide is a new post with all posts in a presentation tied together using a 
custom taxonomy.

Usage
-------

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Move the `taxonomy-cptslides_presentation.php` file to your theme directory
3. Navigate to your permalinks page to flush your rewrite rules
4. Start making presentations

I thought it would be cool to put this up here so others in the Boston and 
greater WordPress community could help build it out. Reach out to me on 
Twitter: [@JonDBishop](http://twitter.com/jondbishop) or through my website: [jonbishop.com/contact](http://www.jonbishop.com/contact/) 
if you want commit rights to work on the plugin.

I've got no specific goals in mind so I'm open to whatever the community has to 
offer.
